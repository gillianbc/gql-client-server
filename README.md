# gql-client-server
Basic graphql server and client

How is it that I do a course, get quite into the details and then forget all the basics?  
I only master things when I start back at the basics again and practice over and over.  
First time through, very little sinks in.  Second time through is whe I really start 
to understand what's going on, the nuances.
